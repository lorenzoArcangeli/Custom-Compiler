# Custom Compiler in C#

This project implements a custom compiler written in C#. It performs several typical phases of the compilation process, including lexical analysis, parsing, AST construction, and type checking.

---

## Main Features

- **Lexical Analysis**  
  Utilizes a lexer generated with *Gardens Point LEX (GPLEX)* to tokenize the source code.

- **Parsing**  
  Uses a parser generated with *Gardens Point Parser Generator (GPPG)* to analyze the syntactic structure of the code.

- **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**  
  Defined in `AbstractSyntax.cs`, the AST represents expressions, declarations, functions, and other language constructs.

- **Type Checking**  
  Implemented in `TypeChecker.cs` using the Visitor pattern to traverse the AST, ensuring semantic correctness and reporting errors with precise line and column information.

- **Error Reporting**  
  The compiler outputs error messages with line and column details to facilitate debugging.

## Prerequisites

- **.NET SDK**: Ensure you have .NET (version 5.0 or higher) or Visual Studio installed.
- **Tools Used**:  
  - *Gardens Point LEX (GPLEX)* for generating the lexer.
  - *Gardens Point Parser Generator (GPPG)* for generating the parser.
  - The [QUT.Gppg](https://github.com/QutEcoacoustics/Qut.Gppg) library (or its NuGet package) is included in the project.

## Installation and Compilation

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
   cd <REPOSITORY_NAME>

2. **Build the Project*				*
Using the .NET CLI:
   ```bash
   dotnet build
Alternatively, open the project in Visual Studio and build using the IDE.

## Usage

The compiler can be executed from the command line. The usage is as follows:
- To compile a source file:
  ```bash
  dotnet run -- <SOURCE_FILE>
- To read from standard input:
  ```bash
  dotnet run -- -t
If the source code compiles correctly and passes type checking, the compiler will output "pass". Otherwise, it will display error messages indicating the line and column where issues were detected.

## Project Structure

- **Program.cs**
The entry point of the compiler. It manages reading the source (from a file or standard input), invoking the lexer and parser, and finally performing type checking.
- **Lexer.cs**
Implements lexical analysis. This file is automatically generated by GPLEX.
- **Parser.cs**
Implements parsing based on the grammar. This file is automatically generated by GPPG.

- **AbstractSyntax.cs**
Defines the classes that represent the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), including nodes for expressions, declarations, functions, and more.

- **TypeChecker.cs**
Implements type checking using the Visitor pattern to traverse the AST and ensure semantic consistency.

## Future Extensions

- **Code Generation:** Add a phase for generating machine or intermediate code.
- **Optimizations:** Introduce optimizations for the intermediate code.
- **Language Expansion:** Integrate new language features and constructs.
- **Debugging Tools:** Enhance error reporting and debugging support.
